# Cursor AI Assistant Rules

## Code Style and Comments
- DO NOT add explanatory comments when implementing features
- Code should be self-documenting through clear naming and structure
- Only add comments for complex business logic or non-obvious implementations
- Avoid redundant comments that simply restate what the code does

## Documentation Language
- ALL documentation must be written in English
- This includes README files, API documentation, code comments, and inline documentation
- Use clear, concise English without unnecessary jargon

## Code Quality
- Follow the configured Biome rules for formatting and linting
- Use TypeScript strictly - avoid `any` types
- Prefer functional programming patterns where appropriate
- Write small, focused functions with single responsibilities

## React Specific
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer const assertions and proper typing
- Use proper React patterns (no direct DOM manipulation)
- Handle errors and loading states appropriately

## File Organization
- Keep components small and focused
- Use meaningful file and folder names
- Group related functionality together
- Separate business logic from UI components

## Performance
- Avoid premature optimization
- Use React.memo and useMemo only when needed
- Optimize bundle size when possible

## Testing (when applicable)
- Write tests for business logic
- Test user interactions and edge cases
- Keep tests simple and focused
- Use descriptive test names

## Git and Version Control
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages in English
- Use conventional commit format when possible
- Keep commits small and focused
